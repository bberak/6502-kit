# 6502-kit

A repo with tools for building programs that run on the MOS 6502/6510 and WDC 65c02 CPUs 🕹️

## Prerequisites

- Node
- NPM
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (if using Mac)
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (if using Windows)

> **HEADS UP WINDOWS USERS:** I'm using [Hyper terminal](https://hyper.is/), so if you are using a different commandline prompt - I cannot guarantee that all of the `npm scripts` will work (although they might)

## Getting Started

Firstly, clone the and configure it for tracking repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/bberak/6502-kit.git [new-project]
cd [new-project]
rm -rf .git # Windows: rmdir /S .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/[you]/[new-project].git
git push -u origin master
```

Then, install prerequisites:

```
npm install
```

## Tools

This project will make the following tools available via the **npm scripts** (for MacOS and Windows):

- [ACME Assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/)
- [VICE Emulator](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/)
- [Minipro Chip Programmer](https://gitlab.com/DavidGriffith/minipro/)

You can read more about the functionality of each tool below.

### Assembling

Build assembly files with:

```
npm run acme src/file.asm
```

> Defaults to using `65c02` instruction set. Modify the `acme` scripts in the `package.json` to change this.

By convention, `.asm` files should indicate their output paths using a macro at the top of the file:

```
!to "build/file.prg"
```

### Emulating (for Commodore 64 only)

After assembling is complete, you can run your program on the vice emulator using:

```
npm run vice build/file.prg
```

> You will most likely need to change the assembly instruction set to `6510` see above.

### Writing to EEPROMs 

To write your program to a ROM chip, plug your universal programmer into a spare USB port, then run:

```
npm run minipro build/file.prg
```

> Works with the `MiniPRO TL866xx` series of chip programmers (make sure it is plugged in)

> By default, is setup to write to the `AT28C256` rom chip. Modify the `minipro` scripts in the `package.json` to change this.

## 65xx Assembly Syntax Highlighting

To add syntax highlighting to your `.asm` files - use the [Kick Assembler Sumlime package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Kick%20Assembler%20(C64))
